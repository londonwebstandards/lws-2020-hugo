London Web Standards brings together web professionals who are working for a better web. Our bi-monthly meetups provide them with an opportunity to teach, inspire, learn, network and debate.

Run `hugo server` with optional flags `--disableFastRender --gc -D` to run locally.

Run `hugo` to generate the static site. Process will be automated at a later stage.

To deploy, you can run `./deploy.sh` to run the script. (You might need to adjust permission to run it `chmod +x deploy.sh`).

Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
