## Teaching JavaScript to Sing

_by David Miller [@Orangetronic](//twitter.com/Orangetronic)_

JavaScript has some pretty powerful new(ish) language features these days, and browser adoption is great! Let’s talk about why these features are popping up, get to know them a bit, and see if we can have some fun along the way. We’ll be looking at Set, Map, Promises, async / await, and having some fun with our old friends Object and Array. We’ll look at some of the quirks of the language, ways we can turn them to our advantage, and hopefully have some fun with code along the way.
