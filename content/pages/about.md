London Web Stardards is a group of volunteers that run bi-monthly meet-ups and a yearly conference ([State of the Browser](//stateofthebrowser.com/)) to bring together web professionals who are working for a better web.

We care about a lot of web-related topics like including HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, accessibility, web fonts, UX and front-end performance among others.
