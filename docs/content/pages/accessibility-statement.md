This website is run by London Web Standards, a group of volunteers. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

* change colours, contrast levels and fonts
* zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
* navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
* navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
* listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We've also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

### How accessible this website is

At the moment all content on the site is in the form of text. All text is accessible with assistive technology, presented with colour blind friendly palette, laid out following rules for readability. Typefonts and writing style have also been taken into account.

Should the content of the site change in future, this statement will be updated accordingly.
