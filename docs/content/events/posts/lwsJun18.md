## Re-decentralising the web

_by Calum Ryan [@calum_ryan](//twitter.com/calum_ryan)_

We'll see how the IndieWeb has a part to play in re-decentralising the web: making the case for less dependence on centralised services like Facebook and Twitter without necessarily abandoning them altogether. We'll discuss practical ways forward to achieve this not only as individuals but as a community broadening awareness and inclusion beyond the tech bubble. Plus a look at the latest W3C specifications including Webmentions and Micropub.

### About Calum

Calum Ryan is a front-end developer living in Tonbridge, Kent who also co-organises a monthly meetup called
[Homebrew Website London](//hwclondon.co.uk/) in his spare time: supporting IndieWeb's people-focused rather than project-focused approach. For the past 5 years he's worked remotely for Essex-based digital marketing agency We Create Digital developing customised themes for WordPress and for the e-commerce platform Magento.
